### Hello, world!

I've never been much of a writer and it's definitely not my area of expertise. My journey to understand code has been a long one, jumping from language to language over the years - I never stuck to one!

Through this, it's allowed me to gain exposure to the subtle differences in the languages I've been exposed to.

Being that this is my first post, I am going to keep it short and sweet.

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```
